# Data-Model-GraphQL

## Project Overview

In order to make user held data models useful and efficient, we need to ensure data models follow commonly accepted principles, widely used customs as well as universality to be meaningful and widely compatible.

This project tracks the building of a user held data model and API. It is based on benchmarks such as IAB Techlabs open standard content taxonomy and CINTs open standard taxonomy.

The user data model is used to build customized user data profiles that are accessed using GraphQL. The user makes these profiles available in exchange for customized services by giving permissioned API access, in the form of data profiles. 

Access to data profiles is always controlled by the individual by setting permissions by which access to the data profile is granted. The individual has the ability and right to manage those permissions, granting, modifying and revoking them. 

### Open Slack

To join the discussion on this project and the other repositories, please join the public <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/libertyequalitydata/shared_invite/zt-ddr4t974-MCzsch4FSeux8DrFQ2atbQ">Liberty Equality Data Slack</a> channel. 

### Version Summary

This is the initial version of the API.

The current API does not enforce or include the access permissions. 

It includes some sample data to understand the data model and possible profile use cases. 

### Permissioned Access

### User Profiles

This project demonstrates how a data profile could be accessed using the GraphQL API and user data model. Example data profile queries and responses are shown in the README.md of their appropriate sub-directory: 

1. A media profile where the information made available would be useful for a media company to use to give customized recommendations to the user.
2. A local activity profile where the information made available would be useful for a discounting company like groupon to use to give local activity recommendations to the user.
3. A basic marketing profile that a user could activate using permissions to allow advertisers to customize ads shown to him if/when we wanted.

### How to Use This Project

A current version of the data model and API is available for download and use. 

A hosted version is planned

There are several use cases that are being trialed in segments such as consumer finance, media, travel, similar to this project. Creating different use cases based on this idea is encouraged. For more information and support, please get in touch at developers@prifina.com
